Rangiri
: Rangiri (乱切り) is when you rotate and cut the vegetable.
From the end of long rounded vegetables such as carrot, cucumber, gobo, cut diagonally while rotating the vegetable a quarter between cuts. This not only makes an attractive shape that is good for stews and simmered dishes but also gives bigger surface space to absorb seasonings faster.
